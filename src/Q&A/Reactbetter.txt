React Native creates applications using JavaScript for both iOS and Android. 
It does this by rendering native APs.
using React Native is that when you build an application with React Native, 
it renders “native” mobile UI (as opposed to web views),
so your app will run smoother and better.
React Native also has useful features which make it a learner-friendly
and developer-friendly framework.
It’s rare these days for a developer to create an app for an Android phone 
but not for an iPhone, or for an iPhone and not an Android. 
Thus ReactNative is better then others.
